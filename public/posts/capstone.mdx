## My Reflection on the Capstone Project

Throughout this capstone project, I truly discovered the iterative and collaborative nature of the design process. I learned that design is rarely linear—instead, it involves cycles of brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and refining ideas. Embracing this iterative approach not only improved our final product but also fostered creative problem-solving, adaptability, and resilience.

One of the most profound lessons from this project was the importance of teamwork. Working on the Automated Apple Sorting System, I witnessed firsthand how collaboration can amplify individual strengths and compensate for weaknesses. Our team, with its diverse skills in electronics, mechanical design, and safety enhancements, was able to overcome challenges such as motor overheating and solenoid misfires by pooling ideas and supporting one another. Regular meetings and open lines of communication were crucial—they ensured that all team members were aligned with our goals and could offer innovative solutions to unexpected issues. This cooperative spirit cemented my belief that no engineer works in isolation; our collective success depends on trust, mutual respect, and the willingness to learn from each other.

These experiences have reshaped my view of the professional engineer’s role in society. It’s clear that beyond technical expertise, engineers must balance innovation with social responsibility. Our decision to include worker training alongside automation was born from in-depth team discussions and a mutual commitment to ethical practices.

Personally, I recognized my strengths in creative problem-solving and efficiency—optimizing the system to use minimal energy was a notable achievement. However, I also saw the need to improve my time management skills, as tight deadlines sometimes led to rushed decisions. Moving forward, I plan to adopt planning tools like Gantt charts to streamline my work. Ultimately, this project and the collaborative journey it entailed have profoundly shaped my engineering mindset, underscoring that effective teamwork is the backbone of meaningful innovation.
