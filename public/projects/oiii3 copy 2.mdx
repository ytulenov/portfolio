# Oil Industry Overview

The oil industry remains a cornerstone of the global economy, with **significant impacts** on both developed and _emerging_ markets. This analysis explores production trends, economic impacts, and future projections.

## Production Statistics

### Major Producers (Pie Chart - Chart.js)

<Chart type="pie">
- Saudi Arabia: 17%
- Russia: 15%
- USA: 13%
- Canada: 10%
- Others: 45%
</Chart>

### Production Trends (Line Chart - D3)

<Chart type="line" library="d3">
Year,Production (M barrels/day)
2000,75
2010,88
2020,95
2023,92
2024,97
</Chart>

### Production vs Price (Scatter Plot - D3)

<Chart type="scatter" library="d3">
Year,Production (M barrels/day),Price (USD/barrel)
2000,75,30
2010,88,80
2020,95,40
2023,92,70
2024,97,85
</Chart>

## Economic Impact

### Oil Reserves vs GDP (Bubble Chart - Chart.js)

<Chart type="bubble">
Country	Reserves (B barrels)	GDP ($T)	Population (M)
USA	35	25	331
Russia	80	1.7	144
Saudi Arabia	266	0.8	35
UAE	98	0.4	10
</Chart>

## Technical Implementation

### Sample Code from GitHub
### Repository

Here’s the repository for this project:

#### Update `Chart.jsx` to Handle Scatter Plots
We need to add support for a `scatter` chart type in the `Chart` component using D3.

## Data Table

Here's a sample Excel file with detailed statistics:

<DataTable src="test.xlsx" />

### Statistical Model

```math
Production_forecast = β₀ + β₁*Price + β₂*Reserves + β₃*GDP + ε
```

#### Update `Chart.jsx` to Handle Scatter Plots
We need to add support for a `scatter` chart type in the `Chart` component using D3.

## Data Table

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, NextJs!</h1>;
}
```

### VI. Conclusion 

Our research endeavors to understand the determinants of IMDb ratings, employing three distinct models: Multiple Regression, Nonlinear Regression, and Time Fixed Effects. Our final specification is anchored in a diverse set of independent variables such as Release Year, Runtime, Genres, Number of Votes, Gross Profit, Certification, Directors, and Lead Actors. While certain variables exhibit significant effects, such as Release Year, Runtime, Genres, and Number of Votes, others like Age Certification and certain Directors and Actors prove less influential. We decided to stay with model with the less endogeneity problems and adjusted R² of 0.76 

Despite the valuable insights gained from our models, challenges persist in dealing with categorical variables and the potential for multicollinearity. Addressing these issues remains an ongoing effort as we refine our models and confront challenges related to simultaneous causality and endogeneity. Future research could involve looking deeper into the dynamics between variables through interaction terms, more variables, increasing the sample size, and considering the incorporation of additional instrumental variables. These efforts could fortify the robustness of our models. Harnessing these econometric tools can provide us a more nuanced understanding of the determinants of IMDb ratings within the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of the film industry.
