### Overview
In May 2022, fresh off my first year at the University of British Columbia, I joined KH Stroy, the Kazakh subdivision of Turkish construction giant Altaca Group, as a Head Manager Assistant. The mission was urgent: a Kusto Group-funded residential project named Koktobe City spanning 200 developments and 130,000 square meters was in jeopardy. The previous contractorâ€™s delays had pushed the timeline dangerously close to the September rainy season, risking a six-month setback if concrete pouring wasnâ€™t completed in time. Altaca Group, known for its efficiency, was brought in to save the day in partnership with Kusto Home. They created joined company named KH Stroy which was main contractor for this project. My role was to support the Head Manager by streamlining operations, harnessing data, and coordinating teams across 139 job sites. Over four months, I helped Head Manager to transform chaos into progress, automating reporting, redesigning schedules, and ensuring the project stayed on track.

### My Role
The projectâ€™s scale was big: 21 residential buildings, 81 subcontractors, and thousands of tasks to manage. The biggest hurdle was the concrete pouring deadlineâ€”missing it would halt construction until the next dry season. I dove in, tasked with overhauling a flawed schedule that staggered engineering teams, creating inefficiencies. Using MS Project, I started designing a 25-part schedule plan, synchronizing mechanical, electrical, and architectural teams to work simultaneously in different building zonesâ€”north, south, east, or exterior. By analyzing five months of concrete pour trends, I optimized resource allocation, cutting two months off the projected delay and ensuring completion before the rains. This plan, spanning 139 job sites, required constant feedback from teams and the head office, turning a logistical nightmare into a streamlined operation.

Data drove every decision. Each day, I compiled progress reports from 27 construction sites, collecting metrics like concrete pouring progress, equipment usage, material deliveries, worker attendance, and reasons for absences. I calculated percentages of total work completed, daily progress, and days remaining for tasks and the overall concrete plan. Image confirmations from subcontractorsâ€™ supervisors and comments on site issuesâ€”like machinery breakdowns or delaysâ€”fed into schedule optimizations. Manually producing 120+ daily reports was untenable, so I automated the process using Python (Openpyxl, Matplotlib, Pandas), slashing reporting time by 90%. I also created over 10 custom Excel reports, including performance analyses and concrete pouring records, and predictive reports for 1,000+ tasks through November 2022, giving the team a data to make further decisions.

Technical reporting extended to AutoCAD, where I generated over 10 reports on pile-filling and foundation concrete basis for various housing blocks. These drawings ensured quality and compliance, providing a visual anchor for progress tracking. Beyond routine reports, I tackled ad-hoc requests, like performance metrics for 81 subcontractors, some managing teams as large as 130 workers. Personally, I was coordinating with little over 20 subcontractors. I conducted inspections, resolved disputes, and delivered status reports to the Head Manager. 

Collaboration was at the heart of my work. I communicated constantly with engineering teams, supervisors, and the head office, navigating diverse perspectives. I created an organization chart for the main contractorâ€™s personnel, clarifying roles in a tangled hierarchy. At the projectâ€™s end, I presented my contributionsâ€”schedules, automation, reports, and outcomesâ€”to stakeholders via a detailed PowerPoint, honing my ability to convey technical concepts clearly.

### Skills Acquired
- Expertise in project scheduling and management using MS Project for large-scale construction
- Proficiency in Python automation (Openpyxl, Matplotlib, Pandas) for data processing and reporting
- Technical reporting with AutoCAD for construction documentation and compliance
- Strong leadership and communication skills, coordinating diverse teams and presenting to stakeholders
