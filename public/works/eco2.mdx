### Overview
ECO2 operates an innovative manufacturing plant, initially designed and implemented at the Pilot Plant-INRS, University of Quebec, with a mission to advance sustainable chemical production. The company leverages cutting-edge automation technologies, including PLC/HMI systems, to optimize efficiency, ensure safety, and minimize environmental impact across its production lines. Located in Quebec City, Canada, ECO2â€™s facility integrates advanced monitoring solutions to maintain strict control over chemical processes, aligning with its commitment to eco-friendly industrial practices.

### My Role
In May 2023, I joined ECO2 in Quebec City, Canada, as an IT Support Specialist, tasked with enhancing the plantâ€™s PLC/HMI systems to support its sustainability goals. My primary responsibility was to gather requirements and design a MySQL database for three production lines, utilizing AVEVA InduSoft Web Studio v8.1 to improve system functionality and pave the way for future real-time monitoring of chemical processes like temperature, pressure, and pH levels. I collaborated closely with the Head Geoengineer and the previous IT team, ensuring the proposed solutions aligned with operational needs and safety standards.

To support the system upgrades, I conducted extensive research into InduSoft Web Studio (versions 7.1 and 8.1), diving into resources like the Introduction to InduSoft Web Studio v7.1 and the Quick Start Guide for v8.1. This research helped me understand the softwareâ€™s functionality, including how to create designs, manage database integration, run studio database gateway, and troubleshoot compatibility issues with legacy systems. One significant challenge was enabling local data transmission in an environment with no internet accessâ€”I successfully interfaced with a keyboardless and mouseless HMI system running Windows, connecting it to a local router to facilitate PLC communication. This required creative problem-solving, as I had to navigate a French-language interface and limited site access due to the plantâ€™s operational schedule. Additionally, I explored cloud database integration options, researching platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to propose scalable solutions for future enhancements, even though I couldnâ€™t complete the database connection during my tenure. By August 2023, I had laid a solid foundation for system improvements through my technical contributions, research, and collaboration.

### Skills Acquired
- Experience in PLC/HMI system integration and database design with MySQL
- Proficiency in researching industrial automation software through technical documentation and guides and troubleshooting in constrained environments
- Strong problem-solving skills in constrained environments, including troubleshooting local data transmission without internet and navigating language barriers.  
- Familiarity with cloud infrastructure options (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and their potential applications in industrial automation.
