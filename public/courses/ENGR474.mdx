# ENGR 474: Analog Integrated Circuits

## Course Overview

*ENGR 474: Analog Integrated Circuits*, taught by Dr. Mohammad Zarifi at UBC Okanagan, runs from January 8 to April 8, 2025. Lectures occur three hours weekly (schedule TBD), focusing on CMOS analog circuit design, from MOS device physics to opamp and switched-capacitor circuits. Building on ENGR 351, 353, and 451, it uses Cadence tools for practical application. Assessments include a midterm (40%, Feb 28), Cadence activities/reports (30%), and a final project (30%, due Apr 26), emphasizing design and simulation skills.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-5: Fundamentals**  
  - MOS transistors and modeling  
  - Processing, layout, and current mirrors 
  - CMOS amplifiers 

- **Weeks 6-9: Amplifiers and Circuits**  
  - Biasing and regulators  
  - Switched-capacitor techniques  

- **Weeks 10-14: Advanced Design**  
  - ADC/DAC systems  
  - Cadence-based amplifier and layout design  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Feb 28 (9:30–11:00 a.m., ART 202)  
  - Final Project Due: Apr 26  
  - Final Exam Period: Apr 11–26, TBA (if applicable)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Model MOS transistors and semiconductor behavior.  
- Design CMOS layouts and current mirrors.  
- Analyze and create two-stage opamps and differential amplifiers.  
- Implement switched-capacitor filters and data converters.  
- Use Cadence for circuit design and post-layout simulation.  

## Key Project

### Final CMOS Circuit Design Project  
In groups of up to three, I’ll design a CMOS circuit (e.g., an opamp or filter) using Cadence, from schematic to post-layout simulation. Assigned by midterm (Feb 28) and due April 26 (30% of grade), this project integrates concepts like amplifiers and switched-capacitor circuits, culminating in a comprehensive report.
