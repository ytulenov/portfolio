# CPSC 210: Software Construction

## Course Overview

CPSC 210 is a foundational course at UBC that dives deep into the principles of software construction. The course emphasizes object-oriented design, software architecture, and best practices for building robust and maintainable software systems. Throughout the semester, I worked on various assignments and projects that honed my skills in Java programming, design patterns, and testing methodologies.

## Syllabus

- **Week 1-2:** Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
  - Classes, objects, and inheritance
  - Encapsulation and abstraction

- **Week 3-4:** Software Design Principles
  - SOLID principles
  - UML diagrams (Class and Sequence diagrams)

- **Week 5-7:** Design Patterns
  - Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns
  - Practical implementation in Java

- **Week 8-10:** Testing and Debugging
  - Unit testing with JUnit
  - Debugging techniques and tools

- **Week 11-13:** Building Larger Systems
  - Modular design and dependency management
  - Working with APIs and libraries

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I was able to:

- Design and implement software using object-oriented principles.
- Apply design patterns to solve common software engineering problems.
- Write and execute comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality.
- Collaborate on larger software projects using version control (Git).

## Key Projects

### Library Management System

Developed a Java-based application to manage a library's book inventory. The project incorporated the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and included features like:

- Adding and removing books
- User authentication
- Search functionality
