# ENGR 470: Microwave Engineering

## Course Overview

*ENGR 470: Microwave Engineering*, taught by Dr. Thomas Johnson. Lectures occur Tuesdays and Thursdays (11:00 a.m.–12:30 p.m., FIP 139), with biweekly labs starting January 13 (Mondays, 4:00–6:00 p.m., SCI 234). Building on ENGR 378, it covers high-frequency circuit design with transmission lines, waveguides, and S-parameters, using Cadence AWR tools. Assessments include labs (20%), three tests (30%), and a final exam (50%), with hands-on amplifier and filter design.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-5: Transmission Lines**  
  - Frequency-dependent materials and line types (coaxial, microstrip)  
  - Impedance, Smith Chart, and matching circuits  

- **Weeks 6-9: Circuit Design**  
  - S-parameters and amplifier design  
  - Noise figure and CAD simulations  

- **Weeks 10-14: Advanced Topics**  
  - Waveguides and filter design (Richard’s transformation)  
  - Lab-based prototyping and testing  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Test 1: Jan 23  
  - Test 2: Feb 13  
  - Test 3: Mar 13  
  - Final Exam: Apr 11–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Analyze high-frequency limitations of lumped circuits.  
- Design matching circuits using the Smith Chart.  
- Build and test a microwave amplifier with S-parameters.  
- Measure circuit performance with a vector network analyzer.  
- Convert lumped filters to transmission line designs.  

## Key Project

### Microwave Amplifier and Filter Labs  
Across six labs (20% of grade), I’ll design, simulate, and build a microwave amplifier and filter using Cadence AWR and surface-mount components. Labs 1–5 (SCI 234) focus on simulation, while Lab 6 (EME 1220) involves assembly and testing, culminating in a verified prototype submitted via Canvas reports.
