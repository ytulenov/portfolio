# ENGR 499: Engineering Capstone Design Project

## Course Overview

*ENGR 499: Engineering Capstone Design Project*, coordinated by Dr. Kenneth Chau and Dr. Alon Eisenstein at UBC Okanagan, spans two terms from September 3, 2024, to April 26, 2025. This six-credit course features weekly lectures in Term 1 (schedule TBD) and self-directed study in both terms. Teams tackle real-world engineering problems, guided by faculty advisors, producing a comprehensive design report and presentations. Assessments include client meetings (35%), reports (30%), presentations (30%), and an ePortfolio (5%), fostering professional engineering skills.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Design an engineering solution for a complex, open-ended problem, identifying needs, constraints, and specifications.  
- Generate, evaluate, and test design solutions using appropriate tools and standards.  
- Integrate ethical, safety, and environmental considerations into design decisions.  
- Communicate designs effectively through written reports and oral presentations.  
- Demonstrate professional behavior in a team, including leadership and teamwork skills.  
- Reflect on my role and responsibilities as a professional engineer in society.  

## Key Project

### Automated Apple Sorting System  
In a team of six—Andrestine Jr. Tan, Taymour Metwalli, Rishan Pfaender, Ethan Walters, Omar Noury and Myself — I’m designing an Automated Apple Sorting System for JA Orchards LTD in Vernon, B.C., under the guidance of faculty advisors Dr. Richard Aleong, Dr. Louzanne Bam, and Dr. Mehran Shirazi. This project responds to the closure of a regional apple sorting facility in July 2024, which left JA Orchards without a reliable means to process their harvest. Previously, they outsourced sorting to a large-scale plant, but its shutdown disrupted their workflow, increased labor demands, and threatened product quality consistency. Our goal is to restore their operational capacity with a custom, on-site solution tailored to their mid-sized orchard.

The system is a mechanical design integrating with an existing AI vision system (provided externally) that grades apples by size, color, and defects. We’re tasked with creating a 3D CAD model using SolidWorks to sort 100 apples per minute into six 48”x48”x28” bins, diverting them from a single-file conveyor belt. The design must handle apples ranging from 72 to 152 mm in diameter, minimizing bruising with low-impact mechanisms, and fit within a 10–15-meter footprint allocated by JA Orchards. It targets a budget of $100k–$200k for materials and production, using readily available, food-safe components compliant with IP66 standards for dust and water resistance, as well as federal and provincial food safety regulations (e.g., Safe Food for Canadians Regulations).

Our approach optimizes for smaller-scale operations, unlike industrial systems that process thousands of apples per minute with bulky, costly machinery. We’re designing a modular conveyor and sorting mechanism—potentially using soft pneumatic actuators or cushioned diverters—to gently guide apples into bins, with a vertical drop no larger than 72 mm to prevent damage. The system will run 24/6, with one day of downtime, and include safety features like enclosed moving parts and easy maintenance access. We’re also planning for scalability, allowing future expansion with additional lines if JA Orchards’ needs grow. Challenges include ensuring sorting accuracy (avoiding misdiversion from sensor or alignment errors), managing wear on mechanical parts, and staying within budget despite potential material cost fluctuations.

Deliverables include a Conceptual Design Report (submitted December 6, 2024), four client meetings with Sulman Ali of JA Orchards, a Final Design Report, a recorded presentation, and a poster for the Capstone Showcase in April 2025. We’ll use SolidWorks Motion Simulation to test performance, validating against functional requirements like throughput and bruising prevention. Optional prototyping with 3D-printed components could refine our design further. This project not only meets JA Orchards’ immediate needs but aims to set a precedent for affordable, efficient sorting solutions for small to mid-sized orchards, enhancing their independence from large-scale facilities.
