# ENGR 359: Microcomputer Engineering

## Course Overview

*ENGR 359: Microcomputer Engineering*, taught by Dr. Richard Klukas, features lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays (2:00–3:15 p.m., Library L317) and biweekly 2-hour labs in EME 1220. Building on APSC 255, it introduces microcomputer architecture, assembly language, and embedded systems, focusing on the ARM Cortex-based Tiva LaunchPad. Assessments include assignments (15%), labs (20%), a midterm (20%, Oct 31), and a final exam (45%), requiring a minimum 40% final exam score and completion of at least four labs to pass. Materials are distributed via Canvas, using *Computer Organization* (Hamacher et al.) as the textbook.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-4: Fundamentals**  
  - Microcomputer structure, instruction-set architectures  
  - Number representation, branching, and I/O  

- **Weeks 5-8: ARM Architecture**  
  - ARM instruction set, I/O, and interrupts  
  - Synchronous/asynchronous buses  

- **Weeks 9-13: Advanced Concepts**  
  - Memory systems (cache, virtual, RAM/ROM)  
  - Pipelining and processor hardware  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Oct 31 (during lecture)  
  - Final Exam: TBD (within exam period)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Identify requirements for microcontroller-based solutions.  
- Design embedded systems with sensors and actuators.  
- Use assembly modeling tools for simulations.  
- Apply practical constraints in embedded system design.  
- Utilize the ARM Tiva LaunchPad for hardware implementation.  

## Key Project

### Embedded Systems Lab Sequence  
Five biweekly labs (20% of grade), completed in pairs in EME 1220, involve programming and testing embedded systems on the ARM Cortex Tiva LaunchPad. Each lab requires a group report submitted on Canvas, applying concepts like I/O, interrupts, and timing to practical engineering problems, ensuring hands-on mastery of microcomputer constraints.
