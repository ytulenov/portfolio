# ENGR_O 418: Applied Machine Learning for Engineers

## Course Overview

*ENGR_O 418: Applied Machine Learning for Engineers* is a fourth-year course at UBC Okanagan that dives into the fundamentals of machine learning, toolboxes in machine learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, applications of machine learning in various engineering disciplines. Taught by Dr. Anas Chaaban, it’s a mix of theory and hands-on Python coding, held in LIB 312 with weekly three-hour sessions. The course equips with knowledge of the theory and implementation of basic machine learning
methods. It starts with an overview of optimization which is a fundamental tool in machine learning. Then
it delves into supervised learning (regression and classification) and unsupervised learning (dimension
reduction and clustering) including both linear and nonlinear models, as well as feature learning and
engineering. The course concludes with an introduction to neural networks. It provides guidance on applying machine learning methods in various disciplines and offers hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, I’ll be able to:  
- Grasp the core theory behind machine learning and its limits.  
- Run experiments with real-world data using Python.  
- Apply ML algorithms to engineering challenges.  
- Break down and evaluate how these methods perform.  
- Team up effectively on a project and write up solid reports.  

## Key Project

### Two-Stage Term Project  
Working in a group of two, I’ll tackle a machine learning problem across two phases. Stage 1 (due mid-term) is about getting the basics down with code and a quick team survey. Stage 2 (due Dec 9-20) ramps up the complexity, requiring a full report and polished code. It’s a chance to pull together everything from the course and make it work on something practical.
