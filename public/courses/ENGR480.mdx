# ENGR_O 480: Modern Control

## Course Overview

*ENGR_O 480: Modern Control* is a fourth-year course, taught by Dr. Mehran Shirazi, focusing on state-space methods for control system design. Lectures run twice weekly (Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30–11:00 a.m.) in LIB-305. The course dives into linear algebra, state-space modeling, stability, and feedback design, with practical MATLAB implementation. Assessments include assignments, a project, a midterm (November 5), and a final exam, emphasizing both theory and application in engineering systems.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-2: Foundations**  
  - Intro to modern control and system descriptions  
  - Review of linear and matrix algebra  

- **Weeks 3-5: State-Space Basics**  
  - State-space solutions and realizations  
  - Stability analysis and concepts  

- **Weeks 6-9: System Properties**  
  - Controllability and observability testing  
  - Canonical transformations  

- **Weeks 10-13: Design Techniques**  
  - State feedback and observer design  
  - Optimal control principles  

- **Assessment Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Nov 5, 9:30–11:00 a.m., LIB-305  
  - Project and assignments ongoing; final exam TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Build state-space models for linear systems.  
- Test systems for stability, controllability, and observability.  
- Design state-feedback controllers and observers to meet specs.  
- Use MATLAB to simulate and validate control designs.  
- Understand optimal control goals and their applications.  

## Key Project

### Control System Project  
The course includes a project where I’ll design and implement a control system using state-space techniques, likely involving MATLAB. It’s a chance to apply feedback and observer concepts to a practical problem, with details provided on Canvas. This ties together the semester’s work into a hands-on deliverable.
