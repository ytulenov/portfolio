# ENGR 353: Semiconductor Devices

## Course Overview

*ENGR 353: Semiconductor Devices*, taught by Dr. Stephen K. O’Leary, features lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays (8:00–9:30 a.m., LIB-L312). Building on APSC 255, the course explores the material properties and device configurations of semiconductors, delivered through five modules on Canvas. Assessments include problem sets (15%), a midterm (35%, Nov 7), and a final exam (50%), using *Solid State Electronic Devices* (Streetman & Banerjee) as the primary text.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-4: Semiconductor Fundamentals**  
  - Crystal properties and growth processes  
  - Atomic/electron properties and band structure  

- **Weeks 5-8: Charge Carriers and Junctions**  
  - Carrier motion and excess carriers  
  - P-N and Schottky junction behavior  

- **Weeks 9-12: Device Applications**  
  - Field-effect and bipolar junction transistors  
  - Optoelectronic devices (LEDs, lasers, photodiodes)  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Nov 7 (8:00–9:20 a.m., LIB-L312)  
  - Final Exam: TBD (within exam period)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Describe semiconductor crystal properties and fabrication processes.  
- Analyze charge carrier motion and band structures.  
- Quantitatively model p-n junctions and Schottky junctions.  
- Explain the behavior of MOSFETs, BJTs, and optoelectronic devices.  
- Apply semiconductor physics to device design.  

## Key Project

### Problem Sets  
Seven problem sets (15% of grade), posted on Canvas, challenge me to apply semiconductor physics to analyze device behaviors, such as p-n junction characteristics or transistor performance. These individual assignments, aligned with *Solid State Electronic Devices*, reinforce theoretical concepts and prepare me for exams.
