# ENGR 378: Electromagnetics for Engineers

## Course Overview

*ENGR 378: Electromagnetics for Engineers* is a third-year course, taught by Dr. Loïc Markley. Lectures occur Tuesdays and Thursdays (5:00–6:30 p.m., ART 103), with tutorials starting January 15 across three sections (T2A: Fri 3:00, T2B: Mon 10:00, T2C: Fri 9:00). Building on APSC 278, it explores Maxwell’s equations, wave propagation, transmission lines, and waveguides, using MATLAB for simulations. Assessments include a midterm (Feb 27), final exam, problem sets, and tutorials, preparing students for advanced electromagnetics topics.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-5: Transmission Lines**  
  - Intro, impedance, reflection, and Smith Chart  
  - Low-loss line analysis  

- **Weeks 6-9: Wave Fundamentals**  
  - Maxwell’s equations and vector potentials  
  - Plane waves in various media  

- **Weeks 10-12: Advanced Waves**  
  - Fresnel equations and polarization  
  - Ray optics and transfer matrices  

- **Weeks 13-14: Waveguides**  
  - Modes and cut-off frequencies  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Feb 27  
  - Final Exam: Apr 15–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Derive plane wave equations in different media.  
- Analyze wave polarization and Fresnel coefficients.  
- Compute waveguide cut-off frequencies.  
- Use the Smith Chart for impedance transformations.  
- Solve microwave circuit problems with S-parameters.  

## Key Project

### MATLAB-Based Problem Sets  
Weekly problem sets, submitted via Canvas, involve MATLAB simulations to analyze electromagnetic phenomena—like plotting impedances or visualizing fields. These assignments, supported by in-class and tutorial exercises, deepen my understanding of wave behavior and prepare me for exam scenarios.
