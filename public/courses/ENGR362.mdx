# ENGR 362: Digital Signal Processing I

## Course Overview

*ENGR 362: Digital Signal Processing I* is a third-year course, taught by Dr. Christopher Collier. Lectures occur Mondays and Wednesdays (3:30–5:00 p.m.), with weekly tutorials across three in-person sections (T2A: Wed 10:00, T2B: Mon 13:00, T2C: Tue 19:00). The course introduces digital signal processing, covering discrete-time signals, z-transforms, Fourier transforms, and filter design using MATLAB. Assessments include assignments, tutorials, quizzes (Jan 31, Feb 28, Mar 20), and a final exam, emphasizing both theory and practical implementation.

  - Quiz 1: Jan 31  
  - Quiz 2: Feb 28  
  - Quiz 3: Mar 20  
  - Final Exam: Apr 15–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Classify and analyze discrete-time signals.  
- Apply z-transform and DFT for system analysis.  
- Determine sampling rates for analog-to-digital conversion.  
- Design and implement digital filters in MATLAB.  
- Distinguish FIR and IIR systems.  

## Key Project

### Digital Filter Design with MATLAB  
Throughout the term, I’ll use MATLAB to design and implement digital filters, applying concepts like z-transforms and DFT from lectures and tutorials. This practical work, assessed via assignments and tutorials, builds skills in signal processing, with no standalone project but a focus on hands-on filter creation.
