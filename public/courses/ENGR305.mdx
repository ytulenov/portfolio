# ENGR 305: Engineering Economic Analysis

## Course Overview

*ENGR 305: Engineering Economic Analysis* is a second-year course at UBC Okanagan, taught by Dr. Babak Mohamadpour Tosarkani, running from January 8 to April 10, 2024. Lectures occur Mondays and Wednesdays (8:00–9:30 a.m., COM 201), with office hours Fridays (9:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m., EME 3269). The course covers economic decision-making tools like time value of money, cash flow analysis, and cost-benefit analysis for project evaluation. Assessments include four case-study assignments, two midterms (Feb 7, Mar 13), and a final exam, emphasizing practical application in engineering contexts.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-4: Economic Foundations**  
  - Time value of money and interest rates  
  - Present/future worth and annual worth analysis  

- **Weeks 5-9: Project Evaluation**  
  - Rate of return and benefit/cost analysis  
  - Public sector economics and replacement decisions  

- **Weeks 10-14: Advanced Analysis**  
  - Budget-limited projects and breakeven analysis  
  - Inflation, depreciation, and after-tax evaluation  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Case-Study 1: Feb 9  
  - Midterm 1: Feb 7 (Ch. 1-5)  
  - Midterm 2: Mar 13 (Ch. 6-9)  
  - Final Exam: Apr 15–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Evaluate engineering projects using multiple economic methods.  
- Perform cash flow analysis and assess asset replacement.  
- Conduct social cost-benefit analysis for public projects.  
- Make informed resource allocation decisions.  

## Key Project

### Case-Study Assignments  
Four case studies (due Feb 9, Mar 6, Mar 27, Apr 12) task me with analyzing real-world engineering scenarios—e.g., comparing project alternatives or assessing replacement timing. Submitted via Canvas, these assignments apply concepts like rate of return and inflation, bridging theory to practice.
