# ENGR 350: Linear Circuit Theory

## Course Overview

*ENGR 350: Linear Circuit Theory*, taught by Dr. Nicholas R. Swart. Lectures occurred Mondays and Wednesdays (8:00–9:30 a.m., ASC 130), delivered in-person with whiteboard-based and partially completed slide notes. Building on APSC 246 and APSC 255, the course covered transient and steady-state circuit analysis, Laplace transforms, frequency response, and filter design, using MATLAB for some assignments. Assessments included assignments (10%), quizzes (10%), a midterm (30%), and a final exam (50%), requiring a minimum 45% final exam score to pass.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-4: Transient Analysis**  
  - First- and second-order circuit transients  
  - Time-domain differential equations and Laplace transforms  

- **Weeks 5-8: Steady-State and AC Analysis**  
  - Phasor-based AC circuit analysis (mesh, nodal, Thevenin/Norton)  
  - AC power, three-phase circuits, and line impedance  

- **Weeks 9-12: Frequency and Filter Design**  
  - Frequency response, Bode plots, and transfer functions  
  - Passive/active filter design (low-pass, high-pass, bandpass)  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: TBD (in-class, announced later)  
  - Final Exam: Dec 10–21, 2023 (TBA)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Analyze transient and steady-state responses using differential equations and Laplace transforms.  
- Apply phasor and power concepts to AC circuits.  
- Generate Bode plots and design filters based on frequency response.  
- Model complex systems using transfer functions and two-port networks.  
- Use MATLAB to validate circuit analysis.  

## Key Project

### MATLAB-Enhanced Assignments  
Weekly assignments (10% of grade), submitted via Canvas, involved solving circuit problems, with later tasks requiring MATLAB for frequency response or filter design. These individual exercises, drawn from *Fundamentals of Electric Circuits* (Alexander & Sadiku) and custom problems, reinforced transient analysis, Bode plots, and filter synthesis, preparing me for exams.
