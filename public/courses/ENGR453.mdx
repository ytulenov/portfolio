# ENGR 453: Internet of Things with Industrial Applications

## Course Overview

*ENGR 453: Internet of Things with Industrial Applications*, taught by Dr. Chen Feng at UBC Okanagan, runs from January 8 to April 8, 2024. Dr. Feng, a researcher in blockchain, AI, IoT, and quantum technologies, brings insights from industry pioneers like Geoffrey Hinton (AI Nobel laureate), IoT advisors, and quantum innovators (e.g., Xanadu). The course explores IoT fundamentals, industrial use cases (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing), and business models, with labs and assignments enhancing practical skills. Assessments include assignments (10%), labs (10%), a midterm (30%), and a final exam (50%).

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-3: IoT Fundamentals**  
  - Core technologies: sensors, edge computing, and wireless networks  
  - Historical context: from 1980s WSNs to 1999 IoT concept  

- **Weeks 4-8: Industrial Applications**  
  - Healthcare (e.g., Apple Watch, preventive care) and manufacturing  
  - AI and edge computing: local processing and cloud integration  

- **Weeks 9-13: Business and Security**  
  - Business models: design thinking and economic benefits (e.g., McKinsey’s $11.1T healthcare savings)  
  - Security: hacking risks and blockchain solutions  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Approx. late February (TBD)  
  - Final Exam: Apr 15–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Describe IoT components and their evolution from wireless sensor networks.  
- Evaluate IoT’s industrial applications (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing).  
- Analyze security challenges and blockchain-based solutions.  
- Assess AI’s role in edge IoT systems.  
- Develop IoT business models using design thinking.  

## Key Project

### Industrial IoT Labs and Assignments  
Through labs and assignments (20% combined), I’ll design IoT solutions—e.g., optimizing edge nodes for a smart coffee machine or modeling a healthcare monitoring system. These tasks, inspired by case studies like the Apple Watch, integrate AI, security, and business perspectives, leveraging Dr. Feng’s blockchain and IoT expertise.
