# ENGR 303: Engineering Project Management

## Course Overview

*ENGR 303: Engineering Project Management*, taught by Dr. Sandun Tharaka Wanniarachchi. Lectures occurred Wednesdays and Fridays (12:30–2:00 p.m., COM 201), with office hours Fridays (2:30–3:30 p.m., EME 3280). The course introduced key project management techniques, including scope, time, cost, and risk management, tailored for engineering contexts. Assessments included quizzes (10%), assignments (20%), a project (10%), a midterm (20%, Nov 3), and a final exam (40%).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Navigate complexities in engineering project dynamics.  
- Manage stakeholders and develop risk management plans.  
- Create project schedules accounting for uncertainties.  
- Apply leadership and communication skills in team settings.  
- Implement quality control and procurement techniques.  

## Key Project

### Group-Based Project  
In groups of five, I completed a project (10% of grade) that demanded advanced coordination to apply project management concepts, such as scheduling or cost estimation, to an engineering scenario. Posted on Canvas, it built on assignment skills, requiring a higher level of effort and delivering practical experience in meeting deadlines.
