# ENGR 360: Engineering Probability and Statistics

## Course Overview

*ENGR 360: Engineering Probability and Statistics*, taught by Dr. Julian Cheng, features lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays (11:00–12:20 p.m., LIB 317) and tutorials on Mondays (10:00–11:00 a.m., T1A), Wednesdays (10:00–11:00 a.m., T1B), or Fridays (8:00–9:00 a.m., T1C). Building on APSC 248 and APSC 254, it covers probability theory, random variables, and statistical methods for electrical engineering, using *Introduction to Probability* (Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis) as a recommended text. Assessments include popup quizzes (15%), assignments (15%), a midterm (20%, Oct 25), and a final exam (50%). Materials are distributed via Canvas.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-4: Probability Foundations**  
  - Set theory, conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem  
  - Independent events and reliability problems  

- **Weeks 5-8: Random Variables**  
  - Discrete and continuous random variables, CDF/PDF  
  - Expectation, variance, and mixed random variables  

- **Weeks 9-13: Advanced Topics**  
  - Central limit theorem, characteristic functions  
  - Parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, signal detection  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Oct 25 (11:00 a.m.–12:20 p.m., in-class)  
  - Final Exam: TBD (within exam period)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Solve reliability problems using independent events.  
- Calculate probabilities with conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem.  
- Generate random numbers using inverse and Box-Muller methods.  
- Analyze PDF/CDF and expectations for random variables.  
- Apply maximum-likelihood principles to parameter estimation and signal detection.  

## Key Project

### Probability and Statistics Assignments  
Nine to ten assignments (15% of grade), submitted via Canvas, involve solving problems on probability, random variables, and statistical methods, such as deriving PDFs or applying Bayes’ theorem to engineering scenarios. Collaboration is permitted, but individual write-ups are required, reinforcing theoretical concepts and preparing me for quizzes and exams.
