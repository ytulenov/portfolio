# ENGR_O 466: Introduction to VLSI Systems

## Course Overview

*ENGR_O 466: Introduction to VLSI Systems* is a fourth-year course, led by Ph.D. Zahra Sarpanah Sourkouhi, that dives into the design and simulation of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits using CMOS technology. Lectures run twice weekly (Mondays and Wednesdays, 5:00–6:30 p.m.) in ART 281, with labs scheduled biweekly on Tuesdays (12:00–2:00 p.m., ART 215) starting October 15. The course covers CMOS transistor behavior, digital circuit design, and chip fabrication, using Cadence tools for hands-on work. It’s assessed through quizzes, labs, two projects, and exams, blending theory with practical skills.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-2: CMOS Fundamentals**  
  - Intro to VLSI and CMOS transistor operation  
  - Non-ideal effects (parasitics, leakages)  

- **Weeks 3-7: Inverter and Logic Design**  
  - Unit inverter analysis (noise margin, delay)  
  - Complex combinational logic gates  

- **Weeks 8-10: Fabrication and Layout**  
  - Chip fabrication process overview  
  - Layout techniques in Cadence (stick diagrams, DRC)  

- **Weeks 12-14: Sequential Systems**  
  - Timing, delay, and flip-flop design  
  - Interconnect impacts (resistance, crosstalk)  

- **Labs (Oct 15–Nov 26):**  
  - Cadence intro, inverter simulations, layout, and verification (DRC/LVS)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Understand how CMOS transistors function and their modes.  
- Design and simulate digital logic gates using CAD tools.  
- Measure gate performance (area, speed, power).  
- Assess interconnect and PVT effects on circuits.  
- Build flip-flops and layouts in CMOS.  

## Key Project

### Project 2: Final Design in Cadence  
For the second project, I’ll design a VLSI circuit in Cadence, applying concepts like logic gate design and layout optimization. It builds on labs and Project 1 (a group presentation on a research paper) and involves a detailed simulation and report, with specifics posted on Canvas. It’s the big finish to tie everything together.
