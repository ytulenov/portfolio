## Key Project

### Ethics and Law Case Studies  
Bi-weekly quizzes (e.g., Jan 17, Mar 7) task me with analyzing real-world scenarios—like whistleblowing or contract disputes—using ethical frameworks and legal principles. Supported by guest lectures (e.g., EGBC, Lawson Lundell), these in-class exercises test my ability to navigate complex professional challenges.
