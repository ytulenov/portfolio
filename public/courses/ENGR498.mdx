# ENGR 498: Applied Machine Vision for Engineers

## Course Overview

*ENGR 498: Applied Machine Vision for Engineers* is taught by Dr. Zheng Liu at UBC Okanagan, running from January 6 to April 8, 2025. The course meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:30–2:00 p.m. in FIP 121, delivering a lecture-based exploration of machine vision fundamentals, system design, and real-world engineering applications. Targeted at students with fourth-year BASc standing, it leverages UBC Canvas for distributing materials, assignments, and announcements. The grading breakdown is as follows: assignments (20%), midterm exam (20%), course project (15%), and final exam (45%).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Understand the architecture and principles of industrial machine vision systems.  
- Develop components for a machine vision system.  
- Implement algorithms for image processing and analysis.  
- Extract useful information from images using processing techniques.  
- Perform pattern learning, detection, and recognition for high-level perception.  
- Design software solutions for real-world machine vision applications.  
- Solve engineering problems using machine vision techniques.  

## Key Project

### Course Project: Machine Vision Application  
For the course project (15% of grade), I’ll design and implement a machine vision solution—likely an application like object detection or quality inspection—using tools such as OpenCV or deep learning frameworks. Assigned early in the term and due in April, it involves a report and presentation, integrating concepts from image processing, pattern recognition, and real-world engineering challenges.
