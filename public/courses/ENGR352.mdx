# ENGR 352: Microelectronics II

## Course Overview

*ENGR 352: Microelectronics II* is a third-year course, taught by Dr. Thomas Johnson. Lectures occur Mondays and Wednesdays (11:00–12:30 p.m., LIB 312), with biweekly labs starting January 10 across four sections in EME 1220. The course builds on prior microelectronics knowledge, focusing on designing circuits like amplifiers, current mirrors, and oscillators, using LTSPICE for simulation. Assessments include assignments, labs, a midterm (March 4), a final exam, and participation, with a hands-on lab project designing a heart rate sensor.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-4: Circuit Analysis**  
  - DC operating points and small signal AC response  
  - Frequency response and semiconductor characteristics  

- **Weeks 5-9: Amplifier Design**  
  - Current mirrors and differential amplifiers  
  - Feedback and transient analysis  

- **Weeks 10-14: Applications**  
  - Output stages and switching circuits  
  - Heart rate sensor design and testing  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Lab 1: Jan 10–19 (Safety Intro)  
  - Midterm: Mar 4  
  - Lab 5: Mar 18–25 (Final Design)  
  - Final Exam: Apr 15–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Analyze DC and AC responses of microelectronic circuits.  
- Design fundamental circuit blocks like differential amplifiers.  
- Use LTSPICE to simulate circuit behavior.  
- Build and verify a pulse rate sensor circuit.  
- Understand feedback and impedance in design.  

## Key Project

### Heart Rate Sensor Lab Project  
Across five labs (Jan–Mar), I’ll design a photoplethysmography-based heart rate sensor, step-by-step: researching prototypes, simulating with LTSPICE, assembling on breadboards, and verifying with an LED pulse indicator. It’s a practical test of design methodology, with a 20% bonus for soldering a complete prototype.
