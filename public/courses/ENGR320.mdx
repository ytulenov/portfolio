# ENGR 320: Electromechanical Devices

## Course Overview

*ENGR 320: Electromechanical Devices* is a third-year course at UBC Okanagan, taught by Dr. Wilson Eberle, running from January 8 to April 8, 2024. Lectures occur twice weekly (Section 201: Tue/Thu 11:00–12:20 p.m., Section 202: Tue/Thu 8:00–9:20 a.m., LIB 305), with weekly tutorials and biweekly labs starting January 22. The course explores magnetic circuits, transformers, and electric machines (DC, synchronous, induction), culminating in a motor design project. Assessments include labs, midterms (Feb 15, Mar 14), a project, and a final exam, blending theory with hands-on skills.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-4: Fundamentals**  
  - AC power and three-phase systems  
  - Magnetic circuits and transformers  

- **Weeks 5-9: Machine Basics**  
  - Intro to machines and DC machines  
  - Synchronous machines  

- **Weeks 10-11: Advanced Machines**  
  - Induction machines  
  - Electromechanical energy conversion  

- **Weeks 12-14: Project Focus**  
  - Design project presentations and demos  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm 1: Feb 15  
  - Midterm 2: Mar 14  
  - Project Presentations: Mar 25–Apr 8  
  - Final Exam: Apr 15–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Solve problems in magnetic circuits and transformers.  
- Analyze loss mechanisms and material properties.  
- Tackle DC, synchronous, and induction machine problems.  
- Design and build a simple electric motor.  

## Key Project

### Electric Motor Design Project  
In the final weeks (Mar 25–Apr 8), I’ll work in a group to design and build a small electric motor or generator, then present and demo it in class. This hands-on project ties together magnetic circuit and machine principles, with lab skills from transformer and motor testing (Labs 1–5) providing the foundation.
