# ENGR_O 458: Power Electronics

## Course Overview

*ENGR_O 458: Power Electronics* is a fourth-year course that introduces the essentials of power electronics, taught by Dr. Liwei Wang. Held in LIB 317 with two 80-minute lectures each week (Tuesdays and Thursdays, 12:30–2:00 p.m.), plus biweekly labs in EME 1220, it’s a blend of theory and practical work. The course covers power semiconductor devices, DC-DC converters, rectifiers, and inverters, with real-world examples from residential and industrial systems. Assessments include quizzes, labs, a design project, and exams, all tied together with tools like PSIM simulation software.

## Syllabus

- **Week 1: Basics**  
  - Intro to power electronics and its applications  
  - Power semiconductor devices (diodes, MOSFETs, IGBTs)  

- **Weeks 2-5: DC-DC Converters**  
  - Buck, boost, and buck-boost converter designs  
  - Voltage and current waveform analysis  

- **Weeks 6-9: Isolated DC-DC Converters**  
  - Flyback and forward converter concepts  
  - Half-bridge and full-bridge configurations  

- **Weeks 10-13: Rectifiers and Beyond**  
  - Uncontrolled and controlled rectifiers (half- and full-wave)  
  - Intro to inverter circuits  

- **Labs (Biweekly, Oct-Nov):**  
  - Simulations (PSIM), hardware demos (Lab-Volt), and prototyping  
  - Final lab completed at home (posted Nov 28)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Understand how power semiconductor devices work and their switching characteristics.  
- Design and analyze DC-DC converters to meet specific needs.  
- Use simulation tools to test power circuits.  
- Interpret experimental data from varying converter duty cycles.  
- Sketch waveforms for rectifier circuits and grasp their roles.  

## Key Project

### Design Project  
In the last three weeks, I’ll tackle a design project to apply what I’ve learned—likely designing a power converter or system. It’s a hands-on chance to work through specs, simulate the circuit, and present a solution, with details provided later in the term. Labs earlier in the course, like prototyping in Lab 4, set the stage for this final push.
