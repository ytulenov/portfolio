# ENGR 315: Systems and Control

## Course Overview

*ENGR 315: Systems and Control* is a third-year course at UBC Okanagan, taught by Dr. Klaske van Heusden, introducing control systems engineering. Lectures run twice weekly (Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30–11:00 a.m. for Section 201, 2:00–3:30 p.m. for Section 202) from January to April 2024, with biweekly labs and weekly tutorials starting mid-January. The course covers dynamic system modeling, stability analysis, and controller design using tools like MATLAB and Simulink. Assessments include labs, assignments, a midterm (March 5), and a final exam, blending theory with practical application.

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-3: System Modeling**  
  - Dynamic systems and block diagrams  
  - Time and frequency domain modeling  

- **Weeks 4-7: System Analysis**  
  - Transient response and stability  
  - Steady-state error calculations  

- **Weeks 8-11: Control Design**  
  - Root locus, Nyquist, and Bode techniques  
  - PID controller design  

- **Weeks 12-14: Implementation**  
  - Frequency response analysis  
  - MATLAB/Simulink applications  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Labs: Biweekly, starting mid-January  
  - Midterm: March 5  
  - Final Exam: April 15–26, TBA  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Model dynamic systems mathematically in time and frequency domains.  
- Analyze stability, transients, and frequency responses.  
- Design controllers using root locus and Bode methods.  
- Implement control systems with MATLAB and Simulink.  
- Apply theory in lab experiments.  

## Key Project

### Lab-Based Control Design  
The biweekly labs, starting in January, involve modeling and controlling systems using MATLAB and Simulink, submitted weekly via Canvas. These hands-on tasks—like designing a PID controller—build practical skills and reinforce lecture concepts, culminating in a deeper grasp of control engineering by term’s end.
