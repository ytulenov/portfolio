# ENGR 351: Microelectronics I

## Course Overview

*ENGR 351: Microelectronics I*, taught by Dr. Stephen K. O’Leary. Lectures occurred Wednesdays and Fridays (2:00–3:30 p.m., ASC 130), with five biweekly labs. Building on APSC 255, the course introduced discrete microelectronic components, focusing on amplifiers, operational amplifiers (op-amps), diodes, MOSFETs, and BJTs. Using *Microelectronic Circuits* (Sedra & Smith), it included five modules delivered via Canvas. Assessments comprised problem sets (10%), labs (15%), a midterm (25%, Oct 27), and a final exam (50%).

## Syllabus

- **Weeks 1-3: Amplifier Fundamentals**  
  - Signals, gain, and frequency response  
  - Cascaded amplifiers and circuit models  

- **Weeks 4-7: Op-Amps and Diodes**  
  - Op-amp configurations (inverting, non-inverting) and imperfections  
  - Diode characteristics, rectifiers, and logic circuits  

- **Weeks 8-12: MOSFETs and BJTs**  
  - MOSFET and BJT device physics and amplifier design  
  - Small-signal modeling and circuit analysis  

- **Key Dates:**  
  - Midterm: Oct 27, 2023 (2:00–3:20 p.m., ASC 130)  
  - Final Exam: Dec 11–22, 2023 (TBA)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, I’ll be able to:  
- Design and analyze amplifier circuits using op-amps.  
- Understand the functional characteristics of diodes, MOSFETs, and BJTs.  
- Perform small-signal analysis and determine bias points.  
- Apply semiconductor physics to microelectronic design.  
- Conduct lab experiments using electronic tools and interpret data.  

## Key Project

### Microelectronics Lab Sequence  
Five biweekly labs (15% of grade), conducted in teams of at least two, explored op-amps, diodes, and MOSFETs. Tasks included characterizing ideal and non-ideal op-amps and analyzing MOSFET circuits, with data collection and analysis reinforcing lecture concepts. Lab reports, submitted via Canvas, provided hands-on experience with microelectronic components.
